Lowest to highest suits in terms of number amount:
◇ → ♣ → ♡ → ♠

Carries are designated by a number for the “amount” of carries; for example: 
K♠ + 2◇ = 2:A◇ (≅ 10(10)) 
*(10) = base10

Addition
Addition is fairly close to regular Base(10) arithmetic. Convert the numbers to Base(10), add, then convert it back into Base(52). 
Bigger numbers are represented by a hard r (linguistically) in the middle of each number. For example:
2◇rK♣ ≅ 26(10) (1 + 25 as a single number)
This is also ≅ A♡. It is required you convert to this when applicable, for this is the simplest form of the number.
Subtraction
Subtraction is fairly close to regular Base(10) arithmetic. Convert the numbers to Base(10), subtract, then convert it back into Base(52). 
Hard r still applies for larger numbers.
Simplest form of the number is still required.
Use the 2:T♡ looping logic in subtraction.

Multiplication	
Multiplication is fairly close to regular Base(10) arithmetic. Convert the numbers to Base(10), multiply, then convert it back into Base(52). 
Hard r still applies for larger numbers.
Simplest form of the number is still required.
Use the 2:T♡ looping logic in multiplication.
